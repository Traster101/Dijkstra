# Dijkstra - Speedrun/Routing tools for PTR

This is a modified version of The Prestige Tree that is much easier to route and speedrun without changing the base functionality of PTR. This exists primarily for me to use personally, but so long as it's on GitHub it may as well be useful.

Adds various features, including the following:
- Hotkey quicksaves with time tracking - k to save, l to load
- Automatic best-time saves after each row unlock
- More precise time tracking
- Average gain/sec indicators to build optimal routes
- Anything else I forgot to put here
